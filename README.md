# Metis Project-01 MTA Data Analysis

### *Primary Goals:*

Our primary goal in this presentation is to maximize the number of signatures obtained at subway station entrances/exits via street marketing teams, focusing on those individuals who will attend the gala and contribute to WTWY’s cause.

To do so, we will look at MTA subway data as well as NYC Census data to determine, not just the busiest stations, but the stations with the most value-added individuals considering our prompt above. In addition, we plan to look at technology companies in the areas near stations to determine best allotment of street marketing team placement. 


### *Data URLs with labels:*

1. Here is the link to [MTA Data](http://web.mta.info/developers/turnstile.html).
2. Here is the link to [New York Home Prices & Values Data](https://www.zillow.com/new-york-ny/home-values/).
3. Here is the link to [Data Reference: Mapping NYC's top 10 most funded zip codes](https://www.builtinnyc.com/2016/08/09/nyc-fundings-zipcode-2016).


### *Methods/Write-Up:* 

Possible ways to address the problem: 
1. Determine the busiest stations within a set collection period.
2. Determine time of day with highest traffic per station.
3. Look at housing value data in zip codes near stations to determine high-income earners.
4. Determine the presence of other tech companies / external investment in the areas near stations.
5. Plot overlap of stations, high home values and presence of tech investment
6. Determine value-added stations by time of day 


### *Working Steps:* 

#### Step 1 Data Gathering
We used browser extension mass downloader to batch download all of these onto local drive. Data files come from March to May 2019 for marketing the gala event happens in early summer. We then combined above txt files into singular files and read into our notebook. 

#### Step 2 Data cleansing
Determine which columns will be value-added to support our above goals. Drop any columns that are unneeded for our analysis. Critically look at data in comparison to our goals and determine what we needed to edit/clean in order to effectively answer our questions.

After importing the data we find that each day of collection is broken up into 6 ‘collection periods. It appears that the a cumulative count of the turnstiles is taken at the following time: 3AM, 7AM, 11AM, 3PM, 7PM, and 11PM. This means usually there are a total of 6 "4-hour" collection periods within each day of the dataset. 

Looking at the collection statistics it appears that the total number of entrances and exits are cumulative. However, there are random additions and subtractions to the data that we will need to take into account. For example, the cumulative exit count at the end of one day then is lower the following day. We thus need to take into account any outliers in the data. 

For the DESC column we filtered this column for REGULAR so that we do not collect irregular patterns in the data. We should constantly be capturing 4-hour blocks of information or ‘regular’ auditing periods. 

As a start we should take the station/turnstile data and sum to get a daily total of both entries and exits PER DAY. This will give us a look at the top stations in the dataset from an overall volume perspective.

From here, we should take these top stations in the dataset and look at day of the week in order to understand how weekday vs. weekend traffic affects their overall position in the dataset. 

#### Step 3 Data Analysis and Visualization
To do this we group daily entries and exits together and then sum the total traffic. We also break down this daily column into the hourly collection periods to understand how the traffic volume changes per day. Here we will need to first identify our top stations. 

Once we have an idea of the most populous hours we should correlate this data with our external datasets. We have the stations by zip code as well the following:

- Prominent tech companies in the NYC area
- Zillow home values in NYC 

We will focus plotting on the overlap between tech, wealth, and stations.


### *Recommendations:*

We recommend that WTWY staff street marketing team in the following:
Between 4pm and 8pm at 23rd St (highest volume)
Between 4pm and 8pm at Canal St (most affluent area)
Between 4pm and 8pm at 28th (most tech investment/funded)
Between the days, there is a highest volume of traffic on mondays but the difference isn't substantial so we will staff marketing teams across the week. However, the recommendation is not cut and dry and I would recommend doing some A/B testing with the marketing team to dial in placement across the collection period for both time and place.
